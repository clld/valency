# CHANGELOG

## August 31, 2012
**minor improvements**
- switched to human-readable [URL parameters](https://github.com/fanaugen/valency/issues/1)
- improved data import script: skips Brad's dummy records
- added dropdown menu for Languages in the top navigation bar:
  - if you're viewing the page of a language-specific resource such as a Verb form or Coding frame,
    selecting a different language leads you to the same resource (in list view) of that language
  - otherwise it just points you to the language info page

    
  

## Version 0.1.0 (August 24, 2012)
**first usable prototype**
- working Verbs list and Verb detail page
- object-language text is displayed in italics
- in Examples, Analyzed text and Gloss are vertically aligned
- gloss abbreviations show up in <span style="font-variant:small-caps">small caps</span>
- Microroles are listed per Meaning and derived Coding Frames' Microroles are listed separately
