## August 31, 2012
**minor improvements**
- switched to human-readable [URL parameters](https://github.com/fanaugen/valency/issues/1)
- improved data import script: skips Brad's dummy records
- added [dropdown menu for Languages](https://github.com/fanaugen/valency/wiki/Nav-bar:-language-specific-info) in the top navigation bar:
  - if you're viewing the page of a language-specific resource such as a Verb form or Coding frame,
    selecting a different language leads you to the same resource (in list view) of that language
  - otherwise it just points you to the language info page

    
  

## Version 0.1.0 (August 24, 2012)
