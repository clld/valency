<h1>Project description</h1>
<p>
The <strong>Leipzig Valency Classes Project</strong> (funded  by the <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.dfg.de/" target="_blank">DFG</a>) is  carrying out a large-scale cross-linguistic comparison of valency classes. With  respect to their valency properties, verbs fall into different classes in all  languages. The project is inspired by Levin (1993), a classical study of  syntactic classes of verbs in English, which argues that a semantic  classification of verbs can be achieved through applying syntactic diagnostics.  Yet, this study, as well as an earlier study by Apresjan (1967) on Russian, has  not been followed up cross-linguistically, which leaves open the question of  which aspects of these classifications are universal and which are  language-particular. Similarly, valency dictionaries are few in number and  mostly deal with European languages, thus they cannot fill the gap. </p>
<p>To make progress in  the cross-linguistic study of valency classes, the members of the Valency  Classes Project (Andrej  Malchukov, Bernard  Comrie, Iren  Hartmann, Martin  Haspelmath, Bradley  Taylor &amp; SÃ¸ren  Wichmann) have assembled a group of contributors, who are collaborating on providing a  consistent set of cross-linguistic data. The main outcome of the project will  be the <strong>edited volume</strong> (edited by Bernard Comrie &amp; Andrej Malchukov) and the <strong><a href="/about/database">typological database</a></strong> (edited by Iren Hartmann, Martin Haspelmath, &amp; Bradley Taylor) dealing with valency classes across languages. The edited volume, <em>Valency  Classes: A comparative handbook</em>, will contain 30-odd chapters by an international team of language experts addressing the topic of valency classes in individual, genealogically and structurally diverse languages, as well as  general chapters written by the project members. Similarly, the <a href="/about/database">database</a> will be filled in by the volume contributors for the languages of their expertise, but its format is more open, as it can include more languages than can be accommodated in the <em>Handbook</em> (the database contributions is published as separately citable parts of an electronic database).</p>
<p>Both the volume  contributions and the database contributions are based on a database questionnaire  for a selected sample of 70 verbs. These verbs are conceived of as  representative of the verbal lexicon and have been reported in the literature  to show distinctive syntactic behaviour both within and across languages. Apart  from valency frames (or more precisely, <a href="/about/database#coding_frames">coding frames</a>, as manifested by  flagging/case-marking and/or indexing/ agreement), the contributors will  provide information about major <a href="/about/database#coding_frames">argument alternations</a>, both uncoded alternations (such as the Dative  alternation in English) and verb-coded alternations (e.g., passive). Languages  vary greatly with respect to the availability of alternation types and the  distribution of these types over different verbs. Of greatest interest for the  present project are alternations which contribute the most to verb  classification in the sense that they are neither restricted to few verbs, nor  apply across the board. </p>
<p>The volume contributors are  requested to provide a summary of verb class-taxonomies of individual  languages, and are encouraged to try to unravel the principles behind the verb  classification. The database, which is not subject to the same space limitations  as the edited volume, optionally allows contributors to go beyond the 70-verb  list in providing information about regularity of certain patterns across the  lexicon.  More generally, the project  aims to uncover the variability of valency-based verb classification across  languages and to examine to what extent this variability depends on (or can be  derived from) variation in grammatical constructions (coding types;  alternations types) attested in individual languages.
