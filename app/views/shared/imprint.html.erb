      <p>
        The Max Planck Society is a non-profit research facility, which is organized as a registered
        association. All of the institutes and facilities of the Max Planck Society are largely
        autonomous in terms of organization and research, but as a rule have no legal capacity of their own.

      <h2>Liability for Contents of Online Information</h2>
      <p>
        In accordance with Section 7 Paragraph 1 of the Tele-Media Law, the Max Planck Society shall be
        responsible for its own contents according to general legal provisions. The Max Planck Society
        makes every effort to provide timely and accurate information on this Website. Nevertheless, errors
        and inaccuracies cannot be completely ruled out. Therefore, the Max Planck Society does not assume
        any liability for the information provided being up-to-date as well as its accuracy, completeness
        or quality. The Max Planck Society shall not be liable for damage of a tangible or intangible nature
        caused directly or indirectly through the use or failure to use the information offered and/or
        through the use of faulty or incomplete information unless it is verifiably culpable of intent or
        gross negligence. The same shall apply to any software downloads available free of charge. The Max
        Planck Society reserves the right to modify, supplement, or delete any or all of the information
        offered on its Website, or to temporarily or permanently cease publication thereof without prior
        and separate notification.
      </p>
      <h2>Links to Websites of Third Parties</h2>
      <p>
        This Website includes links to other external websites. These external links are designated with an
        icon as follows: <a title="external link" href="http://example.org" class="ext-link">external link</a>.
        References to the subordinate pages of this Website are designated without an icon as follows:
        <a href="#" title="internal link">internal link example</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The respective provider shall be responsible for the contents of any linked external pages. In
        establishing the initial link, the Max Planck Society has reviewed the respective external content
        in order to determine whether such link entailed possible civil or criminal responsibility. However,
        a constant review of linked external pages is unreasonable without concrete indication of a violation
        of rights. If the Max Planck Society discovers or is pointed out by others that an external offer
        linked to by the Max Planck Society causes civil or criminal responsibility, the Max Planck Society
        will immediately eliminate any link to this offer. The Max Planck Society expressly dissociates itself
        from such contents.
