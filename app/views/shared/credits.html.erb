    First comes the developers of the Patterns Leipzig Online Database, Alexander Jahraus, Hans-J&ouml;rg Bibiko, and Robert Forkel. It is primarily due to them that this has become such a very special product, fulfilling all our wishes and going far beyond.

    Next we are grateful to our funders: <b>(i)</b> the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (<a href="http://www.dfg.de" class="ext-link">DFG</a>) for providing crucial funding based on the DFG-funded Forschergruppe <a href="http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~va/" class="ext-link">"Grammatik und Verarbeitung verbaler Argumente"</a> over a period of 3 years (2010â€“2013). And <b>(ii)</b> we acknowledge the <a href="http://www.mpg.de/en">Max Planck Society</a>, both the <a href="http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua">Linguistics Department</a> of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (headed by Bernard Comrie), for generously funding ... conferences and workshops between 2010 and 2013 and providing funds for Leipzig-based assistants and reliable technical support, as well as the Max Planck President for funding for the Cross-Linguistic Linked Data project.
