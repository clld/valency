And (ii) we acknowledge the Max Planck Society, both the Linguistics Department of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (headed by Bernard Comrie), for generously funding seven conferences and workshops between 2006 and 2010 and providing funds for Leipzig-based assistants and reliable technical support, as well as the Max Planck President for funding for the Cross-Linguistic Linked Data project.
